## Feature
A home assistant integration for controlling Jci Hitachi devices, using [LibJciHitachi](https://github.com/qqaatw/LibJciHitachi) backend.

## Installation

### Configuring via UI

1. Create `config/custom_components` folder if not existing.
2. Copy `jcihitachi_tw` into `custom_components` folder.
3. Click `Configuration` button on the left side of Home Assistant panel, and then click `Integrations` tab.
4. Click `ADD INTEGRATION` button at the bottom right corner and follow the UI.

### Configuring via `configuration.yaml`

1. Create `config/custom_components` folder if not existing.
2. Copy `jcihitachi_tw` into `custom_components` folder.
3. Configure your email address, password, and device names, in `config/configuration.yaml`. If device names are not provided, they will be fetched from the API automatically. (not recommended.)
4. Restart Home Assistant.

*An example of `configuration.yaml` can be found [here](configuration.yaml).*

## Frequently asked questions

1. Is the integration usable (does the Hitachi cloud work) ? 
   - If the system status badge on the top is green, the Hitachi cloud worked normally at the last nightly check. Please do not open an issue asking the usability of the integration.
2. I cannot install the integration, the log indicates `Requirements for jcihitachi_tw not found: ['LibJciHitachi==x.x.x']`, where x is an arbitrary version number.
    - Ensure the OS in which your Home Assistant is installed is of the following types: `Windows`, `macOS`, `manylinux`, and `musllinux`, on x86 or ARM platforms. Only 64bit OSes on ARM are supported. Other platforms such as PowerPC and MIPS are not supported.
    - If you still want to run the integration on unsupported platforms, you will need to build(compile) it on your own.
3. When auto mode or fan mode is set, the target temperature stays at the target set in cool/dry/heat mode.
    - If this entity didn't get a valid target temperature before, the target temperature will indicate the minimum temperature.
    - Technically, because the target temperature is not intended to be adjusted by users and changes automatically under auto mode or fan mode, the value is set 2-complement `-1` in 16 bit data type (a.k.a. `65535`) by the Hitachi cloud. We have modified the displayed value to avoid the Home Assistant history plot scales to `65535`.
    - If it is still showing a huge number, please refer to PR #36, you may add extra edge conditions by yourself.

## Known issues

1. Clean filter notification of the dehumidifier doesn't work now.
